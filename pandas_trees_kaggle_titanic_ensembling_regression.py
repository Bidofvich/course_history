### Intro to decision trees

import numpy as np
from sklearn import tree

# Find all the unique genders -- the column appears to contain only male and female.
print(titanic["Sex"].unique())

# Replace all the occurences of male with the number 0.
titanic.loc[titanic["Sex"] == "male", "Sex"] = 0
titanic.loc[titanic["Sex"] == "female", "Sex"] = 1

# Same as above 2 commands
#Convert the male and female groups to integer form
train["Sex"][train["Sex"] == "male"] = 0
train["Sex"][train["Sex"] == "female"] = 1

#Impute the Embarked variable
train["Embarked"] = train["Embarked"].fillna('S')

#Convert the Embarked classes to integer form
train["Embarked"][train["Embarked"] == "S"] = 0
train["Embarked"][train["Embarked"] == "C"] = 1
train["Embarked"][train["Embarked"] == "Q"] = 2

#Print the Sex and Embarked columns
print (train['Sex'])
print(train['Embarked'])

# Print the train data to see the available features
print(train)

# Create the target and features numpy arrays: target, features_one
target = train["Survived"].values
features_one = train[["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare"]].values

# Fit your first decision tree: my_tree_one
my_tree_one = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
my_tree_one = my_tree_one.fit(features_one, target)

# Look at the importance and score of the included features
print(my_tree_one.feature_importances_)
print(my_tree_one.score(features_one, target))

# Impute the missing value with the median
test.Fare[152] = test.Fare.median()

# Extract the features from the test set: Pclass, Sex, Age, and Fare.
test_features = test[["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare"]].values

# Make your prediction using the test set
my_prediction = my_tree_one.predict(test_features)

# Create a data frame with two columns: PassengerId & Survived. Survived contains your predictions
PassengerId =np.array(test["PassengerId"]).astype(int)
my_solution = pd.DataFrame(my_prediction, PassengerId, columns = ["Survived"])
print(my_solution)

# Check that your data frame has 418 entries
print(my_solution.shape)

# Write your solution to a csv file with the name my_solution.csv
my_solution.to_csv("my_solution_one.csv", index_label = ["PassengerId"])

### Overfitting and how to control it

# Create a new array with the added features: features_two
features_two = train[["Pclass","Age","Sex","Fare", 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Embarked']].values

#Control overfitting by setting "max_depth" to 10 and "min_samples_split" to 5 : my_tree_two
max_depth = 10
min_samples_split = 5
my_tree_two = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = max_depth, min_samples_split = min_samples_split, random_state = 1)
my_tree_two = my_tree_two.fit(features_two, target)

#Print the score of the new decison tree
print (my_tree_two.score(features_two, target))

# Create train_two with the newly defined feature
train_two = train.copy()
train_two["family_size"] = train_two['SibSp'] + train_two['Parch'] + 1

# Create a new feature set and add the new feature
features_three = train_two[["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare", "SibSp", "Parch", "family_size"]].values

# Define the tree classifier, then fit the model
my_tree_three = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
my_tree_three = my_tree_three.fit(features_three, target)

# Print the score of this decision tree
print(my_tree_three.score(features_three, target))


### A Random Forest analysis in Python

# Import the `RandomForestClassifier`
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# We want the Pclass, Age, Sex, Fare,SibSp, Parch, and Embarked variables
features_forest = train[["Pclass", "Age", "Sex", "Fare", "SibSp", "Parch", "Embarked"]].values

# Building and fitting my_forest
forest = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth = 10, min_samples_split=2, n_estimators = 100, random_state = 1)
my_forest = forest.fit(features_forest, target)

# Print the score of the fitted random forest
print(my_forest.score(features_forest, target))

# Compute predictions on our test set features then print the length of the prediction vector
test_features = test[["Pclass", "Age", "Sex", "Fare", "SibSp", "Parch", "Embarked"]].values
pred_forest = my_forest.predict(test_features)
print(len(pred_forest))


#Request and print the `.feature_importances_` attribute
print(my_tree_two.feature_importances_)
print(my_forest.feature_importances_)

#Compute and print the mean accuracy score for both models
print(my_tree_two.score(features_two, target))
print(my_forest.score(features_forest, target))
